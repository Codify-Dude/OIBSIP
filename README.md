TASK 1 In Branch Unit_Converter_App

UNIT CONVERTER APPLICATION


This application will aim at helping its users by converting the units from one
another. This app will take input from the user and convert it to the desired
unit and give the result. For example, it will be able to convert a value in
centimeters to Meters or grams to kilograms and vice versa.
To develop this application, Android Studio is required. The knowledge of
XML would be required for the user interface and the Java programming for
the application’s conversion functionality.

TASK 3 in branch Calculator

CALCULATOR

A calculator will be an easy application if you have just learned Android and
coding for Java. This Application will simply take the input values and the
operation to be performed from the users. 
After taking the input it’ll return
the results to them on the screen. This is a really easy application and doesn’t
need use of any particular package.

TASK 5 in branch Stop_Watch

STOP WATCH

A stopwatch is another simple android project idea that will work the same
as a normal handheld timepiece that measures the time elapsed between its
activation and deactivation. This application will have three buttons that are:
start, stop, and hold.
